      For over 10 years I have been immersed in all aspects of Digital Marketing, Search Engine Optimisation and Web Analytics. I also have developed a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, Content management Systems (CMS) and all technical aspects of a website that influence SEO, usability and conversions.

      My experience spans across verticals such as: Fashion, Retail, Health, Hospitality, Travel, Finance and Legal, where I built my expertise as a strategist and web analyst.
      While my campaigns focus on delivering effective SEO strategies, I place a particular emphasis on the search engine accessibility, technical and user engagement factors of a website. I am passionate about providing long-term ROI for my clients.
